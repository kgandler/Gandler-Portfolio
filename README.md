# About me

Hello! My name is Karin, and I'm a second-year MSPPM student. I'm really excited for this class! I was doing a lot of GIS last semester between the intro class and my Systems project, and I've hardly done any this semester. I'm really happy to be able to do some more GIS.

I'm also very excited to be graduating! I'm sad about the cancellation of Commencement, but I know it's for the best. I'm really passionate about affordable housing and urban economies, so I'm hoping to get a job in local government. I have a background in history and if social distancing lasts long enough I'm going to start doing some history-related GIS projects - anybody have any ideas?


# What I hope to learn

I'm hoping to expand my GIS horizons and broaden my skills, both with ArcGIS and with other mapping tools. As much as I'd like to become a GIS expert, I realize that I probably won't be able to do that in 7 weeks,  but I'm hoping that this class pushes me a few steps closer towards that. I'm really excited to learn new ways to use GIS tools and to learn how to create different sorts of products using GIS.
